        <p className="mb-4">
          Hello, I'm Tamim, a dedicated enthusiast in advancing technology, particularly in the fields of <strong>robotics</strong>, <strong>deep learning</strong>, <strong>computer vision</strong>, <strong>intelligent systems</strong>, and <strong>reinforcement learning</strong>. Throughout my academic journey and professional endeavors, I've been passionately exploring innovative solutions in these domains. I find particular fascination in developing autonomous systems that can manipulate their environment, such as the aerial manipulator RavenClaw, which my team and I designed as part of the ME366 course. Leading the project, I ensured the integration of various components and developed its autonomous capabilities, enhancing its stability and functionality at high altitudes.

        <p className="mb-4">
          My projects, such as TARUC-NNAV for autonomous navigation using Aruco tags and the creation of Falcon Two Wheeler Bot from scratch using ROS, reflect my commitment to practical applications in robotics and intelligent systems. Additionally, I've delved into computer vision with projects like the navigation system TARUC-NNAV, showcasing my skills in utilizing camera feeds for precise spatial awareness.
